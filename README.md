# Advent of Code 2021
This is all my final code for Advent of Code 2021! This is my first time doing Advent of Code, and it was super fun.
I definitely wouldn't have been able to do all of the days if I was on my own. Big shoutouts to ElectraMiner for helping me with the harder days. The days I struggled with were frequently because I wasn't sure how to efficiently store or process the data (for example, Day 15). I learned a lot doing this: When I started, I didn't even know what a list comprehension was, and now I use them frequently. I learned about making generators and the efficiency of sets and dicts. In general, I've gotten noticeably more comfortable writing code that doesn't suck.

I used Python because writing Python code is quick and easy, and I already had PyCharm installed as well.

I don't have the first 8 days as I didn't start keeping individual python files until Day 9 (I would just delete the code and use the same file).

The printing for Day 16 was something I added after I got my solution because I was interested to see it, and I think it looks cool.

Day 21's input was hard-coded because it's not worth the effort to read 2 lines from a file.

Days 23 and 24 have no code because I didn't write any. I have no idea how to even start coding Day 23. Day 24 is basically me tracing z through the program.

I wrote a v2 for Day 25 after I finished it becuase I felt like adding some jank to make it shorter. It was fun.

Here are my personal stats for this year:

A couple things to point out:
1. I didn't know about Advent of Code until Day 5
2. I went on vacation on Day 19 and fell behind
